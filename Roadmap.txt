NOTICE: 
Big News: * I Intend to release in 2015/01/xx
In the future, I'll move the project to Android Studio.

Catalano Framework 1.4 road map
-----------------------------------------


Version updates and fixes:

* Catalano.Android.Image
    - Added: Clear method in FastBitmap.
    - Added: get; setCoordinateSystem. (Now you can work with X and Y coordinates or I and J like the matrix.)
    - Added: getData method.
    - Added: indicateGrayscale in FastBitmap. (Used to optimized some filters to avoid clone in the memory.)

    - Optimized: Several operation filters (e.g grayscale, log, etc...)**
    - Optimized: Several filters that need to do a copy*.
* There are using recycle internally when needs some copies.
** There are directly accessing the pixels.

* Catalano.Core.Structs
   - New: Binary Heap.

* Catalano.Image
   - Added: get; setCoordinateSystem.
   - Added: get; setRGBData method.
   - Added: get; setGrayData method.

   - Fixed: some constructors in FastBitmap when are loading argb images.

* Catalano.Image.Filters
   - New: Separable Convolution.
   - New: Image Pyramids.
   - New: Weber Local Descriptor.

   - Removed: get; setArithmetic in Sauvola/Niblack/WolfJoulion Threshold. (these filters are using separable convolution for to enhance the performance)

   - Renamed: Fast Gaussian Blur to Gaussian Box Blur.

   - Fixed: Replicate option in Convolution (fixed in Concurrent too).
